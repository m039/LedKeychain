# LED Keychain with CH32V003

This project is inspired by these two YouTube videos: [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnIGLcxYmrs&t=56s) and [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnIGLcxYmrs&t=56s). But the main differences are that it uses CH32V003 microcontroller and all related files are open sourced too. You can also view how it works in SimulIDE.
